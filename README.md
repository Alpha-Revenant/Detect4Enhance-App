📘 Detect4Enhance: Detecting and Enhancing Student Engagement in Online Classrooms
Detect4Enhance is a Final Year Project (FYP) focused on detecting and improving student engagement during online learning sessions. Using computer vision techniques and deep learning (ResNet50), the system analyzes facial expressions from video input to classify emotional states such as Engaged, Bored, Confused, and Frustrated. The goal is to provide actionable insights to educators and support students through features like real-time detection, graphical engagement reports, and personalized reminders or quizzes.

🔍 Key Features:
Real-time facial expression detection using the DAiSEE dataset.
Engagement classification via deep learning.
Graphical visualization of student engagement trends.
Break reminders and mini quizzes to re-engage students.
User-friendly mobile interface for students and instructors.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python, OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow
ResNet50 Model
React Native (Mobile Front-end)
Firebase (Authentication & Database)
Adobe XD (Prototype Design)
Docker (for deployment setup)
